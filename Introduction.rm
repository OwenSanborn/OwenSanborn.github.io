Welcome! This is a personal Github page for Owen Sanborn.

I am a graduate student at Boston University, pursuing my PhD in cell biology and genetics. While I spend much of my time in the lab, I dabble in bioinformatics and machine learning. This page will be a dumping ground of casual projects big and small. Thank you for reading!
