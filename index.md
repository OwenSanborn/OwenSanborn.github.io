## Welcome to my website
I'm a PhD Student at Boston Univeristy in the lab of [Dr. Daniel Cifuentes](https://www.cifulab.com/). I previously worked with [Dr. Dan Barouch](https://cvvr.hms.harvard.edu/lab/barouch-laboratory/) at HMS investigating SARS-CoV-2 and HIV pathology and vaccinology. Then I worked for at Laronde Therapeutics, now [Sail Biomedicines](https://www.sail.bio/) developing circRNA vaccines against viruses. My current research is in RNA-protein interactions, microRNA, and zebrafish embryogenesis. I am passionate about molecular biology, but encounter sequencing and genomics datasets daily. By necessity, I am dappling in computational biology and machine learning.

I'm not injecting embryos or front of a computer screen, I'm probably lifting weights, playing tennis, or caring for my plants.

## Check out some of my latest work
I write short pieces on current topics that capture my interest. I as learn programming and computational biology, I also post small projects. These projects may be tangental to my current research, but this work is my own.
